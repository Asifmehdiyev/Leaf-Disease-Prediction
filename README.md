Leaf Disease Prediction with Deep Learning
Leaf Disease Prediction is strongly related with Biological problems. I used this dataset for using within Deep Learning techniques and make predictions.



libraries used for this case:
numpy - numerical python library for mathematical operations
pandas - python library for working with dataframes
os = Module in Python for creating and removing directory folders
torch - Deep Learning library
fastai - Deep Learning library for large scale datasets
fastai.vision - All necessary fastai functions
fastai.vision.all -
